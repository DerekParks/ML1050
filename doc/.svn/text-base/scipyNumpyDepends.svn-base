Document to help us see what libraries depend on what and how to install them.
Right now this doc refers to SciPy and NumPy, with ATLAS and LAPACK as the 
dependencies.

ATLAS library needs the processer to NOT THROTTLE, but Alamode's machines 
have throttling on, and turning it off needs root controls.  What do we do????

Installs taking from the following link:
http://scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/Linux

Scipy 0.6.0 (compatible with NumPy 1.0.3.1 and later)
  NumPy  1.0.4
	Atlas  (latest is 3.8, guide does it with 3.3.3...)
		lapack (linear algebra) 3.1.1

Python 2.5.1 (Alamode)

------------------------
DESCRPTIONS OF LIBRARIES
------------------------

LAPACK 
	simultaneous linear equations
	least-squares solutions of lin sys of eq
	eigenvalue problems
	QR decomposition

ATLAS
	automaticlly generate an optimized BLAS library (used by LAPACK)
	creates an optimized library for the particular install
	allows complicated LA operations to be very efficient

NumPy
	Adds support for large, multi-D arrays and matrices
	large library of functions to operate on the them

SciPy
	provides more functionality, matlab like
	library of algorithms and mathematical tools
	modules for optimization, integration, special functions, 
	signal/image processing, genetic algorithms, ODE solvers
	basic datastructure is array provided in NumPy

INSTALL
-------------

Install LAPACK:

wget http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-3.1.1.tgz
tar zxvf lapack-3.1.1.tgz
cd lapack-3.1.1
cp INSTALL/make.inc.gfortran make.inc

edit make.inc with the following:

OPTS = -O2 -fPIC             (Note, first value is letter O, not zero, second value is a number. same as below)
NOOPT = -O0 -fPIC

run make:

cd SRC
make

This creates lapack_LINUX.a in the head lapack directory.

Install ATLAS:

wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/math-atlas/atlas3.8.0.tar.bz2
tar jxvf atlas3.8.0.tar.bz2
cd ATLAS
mkdir ATLAS_LINUX
cd ATLAS_LINUX
../configure -Fa alg -fPIC --with-netlib-lapack=/path/to/lapack/lapack_LINUX.a
make

*********** I get an error on the configure because alamode machines have CPU throttling turned on, which makes 
*********** ATLAS useless.  *punched in the nuts*  /usr/bin/cpufreq-selector -g performance turns it off, but its SUDO

Install NumPy:

wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/numpy/numpy-1.0.4.tar.gz
gunzip numpy-1.0.4.tar.gz
tar xvf numpy-1.0.4.tar
cd numpy-1.0.4
python setup.py install

Install SciPy:

wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scipy/scipy-0.6.0.tar.gz
gunzip scipy-0.6.0.tar.gz
tar xvf scipy-0.6.0.tar
cd scipy-0.6.0
python setup.py install --PREFIX=$MYDIR
